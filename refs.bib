  abstract = {We prove a lower bound of the formNΩ(1) on the degree of polynomials in a Nullstellensatz refutation of theCountqpolynomials over ℤm, whereq is a prime not dividingm. In addition, we give an explicit construction of a degreeNΩ(1)design for theCountqprinciple over ℤm. As a corollary, using Beameet al. (1994) we obtain a lower bound of the form 2NΩ(1) for the number of formulas in a constant-depth Frege proof of the modular counting principleCountqNfrom instances of the counting principleCountmM.},
